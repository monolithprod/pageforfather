<h3>The Epic of Martin</h3>
<p>Born in a bygone age, in a place long forgotten.<br>
A prophecy spoke of a Pitcairn and Watson,<br>
Two highlanders who would fight through the cold,<br>
and unite together to break the mold,<br>
of a family mired in divorce and defeat,<br>
to always stay true, through rain snow and sleet.<br>
This monolith of a man, took his lady by hand,<br>
and together they formulated a plan,<br>
to raise a family down south in England.<br>
<br>
Many years passed and babies were born,<br>
and yet still they lived in the land of forlorn,<br>
What tragedy blooms when surrounded by neds,<br>
This powerful man grew tired of dickheads,<br>
With final child born, he didn't have long,<br>
before his oldest could soon start to do wrong,<br>
so they gathered their things and set off to move on.<br>
<br>
For Martin to take his family there,<br>
he had to seek out Hercules the bear,<br>
500 pounds of flesh muscle and hair,<br>
the beast roared, "submit me if you dare!"<br>
But Martin was quicker than bats out of hell,<br>
and wrestled the monster until it fell,<br>
beast begging for mercy, Martin doesn't sell,<br>
he just laughed, standing tall alongside the death knell.<br>
<br>
With thunderous applause, Martin had won the right,<br>
to seek comfort down south, and forget the fight,<br>
to raise his family far away from the blight,<br>
like the rough dodgy Scotsmen that came out at night.<br>
The journey was long, but no terrible plight,<br>
for the only horror that could give them fright,<br>
was the boring old neighbours chatting their trite,<br>
and the contractors cutting the fields grass like shite.<br>
<br>
It was not before long that he could finally see,<br>
the journey they made to the land of tea,<br>
was the right choice to make for his family to be,<br>
happy and prosperous, forever peacefully.<br>
<br>
Shame about the middle child.<br>
<br>
With love, Matthew<br>
